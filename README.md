# AWS-Cryptocurrency-App
This repository contains code used to create an application that visualises realtime cryptocurrency data. App is deployed on AWS EC2 instance.

App is accessible [here.](http://51.20.138.217:8050/)

Data is updated every 00:00AM CEST to display new data. For cost efficiency, data is updated once every 24 hours, but the project is suited for real time data display if needed.
